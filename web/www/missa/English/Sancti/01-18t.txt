[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:13-19
v. And Jesus came into the quarters of Cesarea Philippi: and he asked his~
disciples, saying: Whom do men say that the Son of man is? But they said: Some~
John the Baptist, and other some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the~
prophets. Jesus saith to them: But whom do you say that I am? Simon Peter~
answered and said: Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus~
answering, said to him: Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and~
blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And I say to~
thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the~
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the keys of~
the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be~
bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be~
loosed also in heaven.
