[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:13-19
v. At that time, Jesus,~
having come into the district of Cesarea Philippi,~
began to ask His disciples, saying, "Who do men~
say the Son of Man is?" But they said, "Some say,~
John the Baptist; and others, Elias; and others,~
Jeremias, or one of the prophets." He said to them,~
'But who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter~
answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son~
of the living God." Then Jesus answered and said,~
"Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona, for flesh and~
blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father~
in heaven" And I say to you, you are Peter, and~
upon this rock I will build My Church, and the~
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will~
give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and~
whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound~
in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on earth~
shall be loosed in heaven."

We beseech You, O Lord, may the prayer of the blessed Apostle, Peter, recommend~
